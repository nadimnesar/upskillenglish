# UpskillEnglish

UpskillEnglish is a web application designed to enhance English proficiency through two focused sections: **Practice Zone** and **Assessment Zone**. Whether you're looking to hone your skills or evaluate your progress, UpskillEnglish offers a comprehensive solution for advanced English learners.

## Features

### 1. Practice Zone
The Practice Zone is designed to help users improve their English through various interactive tools. Key features include:

- **Passage Learning Lab:** Users can access new academic-level passages, with translation options to aid comprehension.
- **Question Practicing Hub:** Generate four types of reading-related questions by inputting a passage, helping users engage with diverse question formats.
- **Improve Writing:** Submit written responses on specific topics and receive detailed corrections and feedback to refine writing skills.
- **Improve Listening:** Play audio clips to practice listening, with text and translation support to reinforce understanding.

### 2. Assessment Zone
The Assessment Zone allows users to test their English proficiency through a structured and rigorous evaluation process. This section provides instant feedback and detailed scoring:

- **Quick Practice:** Focused on testing core language skills such as grammar, sentence completion, synonyms, antonyms, word usage, vocabulary, coherence, cohesion, and idioms. Immediate correction is provided after submission.
- **Reading Test:** A two-part reading test designed to assess key reading abilities. 
  - **Part 1:** Evaluates fact-checking and text cohesion.
  - **Part 2:** Focuses on paragraph matching and understanding.
- **Writing Test:** Two sections that assess written communication skills.
  - **Part 1:** Graph analysis and interpretation.
  - **Part 2:** Essay writing on a given topic.
- **Listening Test:** Users listen to an audio clip and answer various question types to assess their listening skills.

Each of the assessment features provides a score upon test completion, and a **Leaderboard** feature displays user rankings based on their performance.
